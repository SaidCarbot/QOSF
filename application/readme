Quantum Operations Simulation in Python

This Python code uses NumPy to simulate basic quantum operations. It initializes quantum states, applies gates like X, H, and CNOT to specific qubits, 
and measures runtime based on qubit count to illustrate scalability limits.

Key Features:
State Initialization: initialize_qubits(n) sets up an n-qubit system in state |0‚ü©.
Gate Application: Functions apply gates (X, H) and CNOT between qubits using the Kronecker product.
Performance Analysis: Measures runtime for n-qubit systems, visualizing how computational load grows with system size.
Memory Estimation: Calculates the max number of qubits feasible on a classical computer based on memory constraints.
This project is ideal for understanding basic quantum operations, entanglement, and the limits of quantum simulations on classical hardware.
